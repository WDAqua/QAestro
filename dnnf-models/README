Requirements
------------
If multiple precision (MP) arithmetic required, need to install the GMP library for
the correct word-size (default is 32 bits). If you install GMP, uncomment the
-DMP and -lgmp in Makefile and nnf/Makefile.

Installation
------------
  1. Uncompress the tar
  2. (cd nnf ; make)
  3. make

Execution
---------
  ./models [-m] [-w] <file.dnnf>

-w enumerate the models
-m model counting is done is MP arithmetic
