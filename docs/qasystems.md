title: QA systems & tasks

QA systems implement abstract QA tasks to answer questions posed by humans. QA tasks include question analysis, query construction, and the evaluation of the generated query over a knowledge base to answer the input question.

__Question Analysis__: Using different techniques, the input question is analyzed linguistically to identify syntactic and semantic features. The following techniques form important subtasks:

- _Tokenization_: A natural language question is fragmented into words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful units known as tokens.

- _POS Tagging_: The part of speech, such as noun, verb, adjective, and pronoun, of each question word is identified and attached to the word as a tag.

- _Dependency Parsing_: An alternative form of syntactic representation of the question to form a tree-like structure is created where arcs (edges in the tree) indicate that there is a grammatical relation between two words, whereas the nodes in the tree are the words (or tokens) in the question. 

- _Recognition_: An input question is parsed to identify the sequence of words that represent a person, a thing, or any other entity.

- _Disambiguation_: The identity of the entity in the text is retrieved and then linked to its mentions in knowledge bases such as DBpedia.

- _Linguistic Triple Generation_: Based on the input natural language question, triple patterns of the form <query term, relation, term> are generated.

__Data Mapping__: Information generated by Query Analyzer such as entities, tokens, and other question terms is mapped to its mentions in online knowledge bases such as DBpedia or Freebase.

__Query Generating__: SPARQL queries are constructed; generated queries represent input questions over entities and predicates in online knowledge bases. 

__Answer Generating__: The SPARQL queries are executed on the end points of knowledge bases to obtain the final answer. 

Other QA Tasks include:

- _Question Type Identification_: This task identifies the type of the question. The input is the natural language question; the output is the type of the question, e.g., yes-no, location, person, time, or reason.

- _Answer Type Identification_: This task identifies the desired type of the final answer. This task is sometimes performed as a part of the Question Analysis task or as a subtask of Answer Generation.

- _Query Ranking_: In some of the QA systems, the task Query Generation generates multiple candidate queries. This task ranks the generated SPARQL queries using a ranking function and it helps to select the best ranked query.

- _Syntactic Parsing_: The input question is represented in the form of a syntactic tree, consisting of identified nouns, verbs, adjectives, relations, etc. However, this task may use as input natural language question or POS tags which makes it different from POS Tagging. 

The above QA task definitions describe the logical structure of an abstract QA pipeline. However, QA systems implement these tasks differently, sometimes combining several of these tasks in different order or skipping some of the tasks. The following table contains 51 QA components from existing QA systems that implement the QA tasks discussed here. This has been used as input in order to [semantify the QA components](/QAestro/qacomponents).
