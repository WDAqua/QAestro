# Installation of QAestro
## Requirements
The following instructions are for installation of QAestro in Linux Fedora >=23. For different Linux versions or operating systems follow the steps described in [Installation of QAestro with docker](#installation-of-qaestro-with-docker).
- Install Python 2.7 or newer
- Install the following libraries `gcc-c++`, `glibc.i686`, and `libstdc++.i686`

    ```
    sudo apt-get install gcc-c++ glibc.i686 libstdc++.i686
    ```

## Execution of QAestro scripts
Given a set of views and a query you can produce all rewritings by executing

`./run_QAestro.sh <views> <query> <output>`

`views` is the name of the file containing the views, `query` is the name of the file containing the query, and `output` is the name of the output file.
Usage example:

`./run_QAestro.sh qa/views/views.txt qa/queries/query_1.txt qa/output/output.txt`

Given a set of views and multiple queries you can produce all rewritings by executing

`./run_all_QAestro.sh <views> <query_folder> <output_folder>`

`views` is the name of the file containing the views, `queries` a folder containing query files, and `output` is the name of the output file.
Usage example:

`./run_all_QAestro.sh qa/views/views.txt qa/queries/ qa/output/`
